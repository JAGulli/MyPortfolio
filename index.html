            <h2>Hiya! I'm Jodi Gullickson</h2>
            <h3>UX/UI Designer</h3>
            <p>At the age of 30, I decided to take my career in a new direction, switching from a six-year career in financial services to one in design. </p>
            <p>I am driven to help small businesses polish their online presence. I enjoy learning the origins and values of each company. I then share these unique identifiers through compelling storytelling and visual design.</p>
            <p>Tools:</p>
            <p>Figma, InVision, Visual Studio Code, Miro, GitHub, Google Suite, Microsoft Office</p>
            <p>Specialties:</p>
            <p>Customer Centric Design, Story Telling, Thoughtful Design Solutions</p>

            <h3>User Research</h3>
             <p>User research is the basis for the rest of what I do as a designer. I take pride in learning as much as I can about how users use the products, as well as their motivations and general attitudes relevant to the project. Digital products that bring people back are delightful, thoughtful & useful. User research helps designers understand what we need to deliver just that.</p>

                </button>
            <h3>User Empathy</h3>
                <p>Empathy has always been a personal superpower of mine, applying it to design is second nature for me. Examples of User Empathy in action I’ve applied include:
                </p>
                <ul class="skill">
                    <li>Adding in secondary donation options for users incase the first is not viable for them. This made it easier for the user to be involved and helped stakeholders collection efforts as well.
                    </li>
                    <li>Key features and functionality easily accessible with one hand for mobile users on the go.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <button>
                    Example in Case Study
                </button>
            <h3>Qualitiative Interviews</h3>
                <p>
                    The better we understand users, their pain points, and their habits the better we can design for them. This will help our designs be more successful. Numbers, KPIs, and traceable changes in useage are all great. As a UX Designer it’s my pleasure to help bring these business needs to life by designing for the very things that make us human.
